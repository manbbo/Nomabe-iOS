### About CoreML

CoreML is a powerful framework by Apple designed to integrate machine learning models into Swift applications. It provides developers with tools to leverage machine learning capabilities directly on devices, enhancing app functionality with intelligent features.

By incorporating CoreML into your Swift application, you can harness its capabilities for tasks such as image analysis, natural language processing, and moreÂ¹. For detailed instructions on integrating and using CoreML in your Swift project, refer to the official [CoreML documentation].
